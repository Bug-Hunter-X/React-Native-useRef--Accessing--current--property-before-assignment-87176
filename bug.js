This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component that is re-rendered frequently, particularly when dealing with animations or interactions that trigger updates.  The problem lies in accessing the `current` property of the ref before it has been assigned a value.  This is often masked by the fact that the initial render might appear correct. However, subsequent renders may cause the issue to surface.

```javascript
// Bug: Attempting to access current property before assignment
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Animated } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const animation = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current; // BUG: Accessing current before assignment

  useEffect(() => {
    Animated.timing(animation, {
      toValue: 1,
      duration: 1000,
    }).start();
  }, []);

  return (
    <Animated.View style={{ opacity: animation }}>
      {/* ... */}
    </Animated.View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

The solution involves restructuring the code to ensure the `current` property is accessed only after it's been assigned.  Using a `useEffect` hook guarantees this, and the conditional check adds an extra layer of safety.

```javascript
// Solution: Accessing current property after assignment using useEffect
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Animated } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const animation = useRef(new Animated.Value(0));

  useEffect(() => {
    if (animation.current) {
      Animated.timing(animation.current, {
        toValue: 1,
        duration: 1000,
      }).start();
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <Animated.View style={{ opacity: animation.current }}>
      {/* ... */}
    </Animated.View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
By moving the animation start to inside the `useEffect` hook and adding the conditional check for `animation.current`, we prevent errors caused by premature access to the ref's `current` property.
